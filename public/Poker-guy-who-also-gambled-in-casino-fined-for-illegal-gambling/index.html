            <h1 id="Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-fined-for-illegal-gambling"><a href="#Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-fined-for-illegal-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Poker guy who also gambled in casino fined for illegal gambling"></a>Poker guy who also gambled in casino fined for illegal gambling</h1><p>A poker enthusiast who liked to gamble in a casino has been fined for illegal gambling.</p>
<p>The man, who is in his twenties, admitted that he had gambled away more than €1,000 at the casino over an eight-month period. He also said he had played poker online and lost around €6,000.</p>
<p>The court fined him €1,500 and ordered him to pay €2,500 in damages to the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-must-pay-back-600-000"><a href="#Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-must-pay-back-600-000" class="headerlink" title="Poker guy who also gambled in casino must pay back $600,000"></a>Poker guy who also gambled in casino must pay back $600,000</h1><p>The poker player who also gambled in a casino must now pay back $600,000, a judge has ruled.</p>
<p>The man from Missouri had been playing poker at the Ameristar Casino in St. Charles, when he began to gamble on casino games as well. Eventually, his losses at the casino totaled more than $600,000.</p>
<p>He was sued by the casino for the money he owed them, and this week a judge agreed that the man must pay back the money. The poker player said that he intends to appeal the ruling.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-banned-from-all-casinos"><a href="#Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-banned-from-all-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Poker guy who also gambled in casino banned from all casinos"></a>Poker guy who also gambled in casino banned from all casinos</h1><p>In a significant move, the world’s largest casino operator, Caesars Entertainment, has blacklisted a professional poker player for life from all of its properties worldwide. The company said that the unnamed gambler had “violated our terms of service”.</p>
<p>It’s not clear what the specific offence was, but it is believed that the poker player had also been gambling in the company’s casinos. In a statement, Caesars said: “This individual has violated our terms of service and is not welcome on any of our properties. We are committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for all of our guests and this individual is no longer welcome.”</p>
<p>The decision by Caesars to blacklist the poker player is likely to cause a stir in the industry, as it is one of the most high-profile cases to date of a professional being banned from casinos. It is also likely to set a precedent for other operators who may now consider implementing similar policies.</p>
<p>There has been no comment yet from the poker player himself or his representatives, but it is likely that he will be considering his legal options. It could be argued that he has been treated unfairly as he has not actually been charged with any crime.</p>
<p>Casinos have been known to ban players who are caught cheating or engaging in fraudulent behaviour, but this appears to be the first time that someone has been blacklisted for life merely for gambling at a casino property.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-agrees-to-forfeit-100-000"><a href="#Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-agrees-to-forfeit-100-000" class="headerlink" title="Poker guy who also gambled in casino agrees to forfeit $100,000"></a>Poker guy who also gambled in casino agrees to forfeit $100,000</h1><p>The Poker Guy has always been a risk taker. On the poker table, he would take calculated risks in the hopes of doubling his chip stack. Off the table, he was willing to take similar risks in casino games like blackjack and roulette. Sometimes it paid off big, but other times he left empty handed.</p>
<p>His risky ways finally caught up with him one day when he was playing blackjack at a casino. He had lost $10,000 over several hours and decided to double down on his next hand. Unfortunately for him, he lost again and was down to his last $1,000. He quickly lost that as well and was now out of money.</p>
<p>In order to cover his losses, The Poker Guy agreed to forfeit $100,000 to the casino. This was a difficult decision for him, but it allowed him to avoid any legal trouble. In hindsight, he realizes that this was a bad decision and wishes he would have found another way to cover his losses.</p>
<p>Despite this setback, The Poker Guy is still determined to win big at the poker table. He knows that there is no such thing as a sure thing in gambling, but he is going to keep taking chances in the hopes of striking it rich.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-agrees-to-pay-50-000-fine"><a href="#Poker-guy-who-also-gambled-in-casino-agrees-to-pay-50-000-fine" class="headerlink" title="Poker guy who also gambled in casino agrees to pay $50,000 fine"></a>Poker guy who also gambled in casino agrees to pay $50,000 fine</h1><p>A professional poker player who was also a high-stakes gambler at a casino has agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and be barred from the casino for one year.</p>
<p>The man, who is in his early 50s, was busted by casino security last month while playing blackjack. He had been gambling away hundreds of dollars per hand and had run up a substantial debt.</p>
<p>When confronted by casino security, the man admitted that he was a professional poker player. He also said that he had gambled away more than $200,000 at the casino over the past two years.</p>
<p>Under state law, casinos are not allowed to let professional gamblers gamble at their venues. In addition to being fined and barred from the casino for a year, the man will also have to pay back all of the money he lost while gambling at the casino.</p>
