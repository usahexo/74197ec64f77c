            <h1 id="Why-AE888"><a href="#Why-AE888" class="headerlink" title="Why AE888?"></a>Why AE888?</h1><p>There are many reasons why the AE888 engine is so popular among Subaru enthusiasts. Some of these reasons include its unique boxer engine design, high-revving capabilities, and impressive torque curve.</p>
<p>The AE888 engine was first introduced in the 1998 Impreza WRX. It was later used in other models such as the STI and Legacy GT. The engine was discontinued after the 2007 model year, but it has since been reintroduced in the 2015 WRX STI.</p>
<p>The AE888 engine is a 2.0-liter boxer engine that produces up to 300 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque. It is a highly revving engine that can reach up to 8,000 rpm. This makes it perfect for track use or spirited driving on twisty roads.</p>
<p>The engine also has a very impressive torque curve. It produces plenty of torque from low rpm, which makes it great for everyday driving. You won’t have to worry about feeling sluggish when you pull away from a stoplight or merge onto the highway.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an exhilarating driving experience, then the AE888 engine is definitely worth considering</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-significance-of-Southampton-FC-and-Heller-in-the-company’s-name"><a href="#What-is-the-significance-of-Southampton-FC-and-Heller-in-the-company’s-name" class="headerlink" title="What is the significance of Southampton FC and Heller in the company’s name?"></a>What is the significance of Southampton FC and Heller in the company’s name?</h1><p>The football club, Southampton FC, and the company, Heller, have a long and intertwined history. The club was founded in 1885 as St. Mary’s Football Club by members of the local church. In 1920, they merged with Southern Amateur League side Northampton Town and took on their current name.</p>
<p>In 1898, the club’s original ground burnt down and they were left homeless. They were saved by local businessman George Heller who offered them a new ground to play on. The ground has been known ever since as the “Heller” stadium.</p>
<p>The two entities have remained closely linked over the years. The club chairman is also a director of Heller and the two companies have worked together on a number of charitable projects.</p>
<p>So why did Heller choose Southampton FC as their company name? There are a few different theories. Some say that it was because of the close relationship between the two entities. Others believe that it was because Southampton was one of the most successful clubs in England at the time and Heller wanted to associate themselves with that success.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, the name remains synonymous with both Southampton FC and Heller and is recognised all around the world.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-their-vision-and-mission-statement"><a href="#What-is-their-vision-and-mission-statement" class="headerlink" title="What is their vision and mission statement?"></a>What is their vision and mission statement?</h1><p>The Vision<br>Our vision with BitShares is to create a more fair and equitable world economy.

<h1 id="What-are-the-company’s-core-values"><a href="#What-are-the-company’s-core-values" class="headerlink" title="What are the company’s core values?"></a>What are the company’s core values?</h1><p>Every company has a set of core values that guide the decisions they make and how they operate. These values are important because they help to define the company culture and create a sense of identity for employees. They can also be a determining factor when it comes to choosing a job or working for a particular company.</p>
<p>So, what are the core values at your company? And, more importantly, what do they mean to you?</p>
<p>For many people, the core values of a company are central to their happiness and satisfaction with their job. It’s important to feel that you’re working towards something that is meaningful to you and that aligns with your personal beliefs. If the core values of a company don’t reflect your own, it can be difficult to be motivated and stay engaged in your work.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that you have to completely agree with everything your company stands for, but there should be some common ground. After all, you’ll be spending most of your waking hours at work, so it’s important that you feel good about where you are.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what your company’s core values are or where to find them, ask your manager or HR department. They should be able to provide you with a list of the values that guide the business. Once you have them in hand, take some time to read through them and think about how they resonate with you.</p>
<p>If there are any values that stand out or strike a chord, write down why. Jotting down your thoughts can help you better understand why those values matter to you and how they fit into your overall worldview. If there are any areas of conflict, think about if there is room for compromise or if it might be time to start looking for a new job.</p>
<p>The core values of a company can say a lot about how it operates and the kind of environment employees can expect to find themselves in. Knowing what they are is an important first step in deciding if a particular business is right for you.</p>
