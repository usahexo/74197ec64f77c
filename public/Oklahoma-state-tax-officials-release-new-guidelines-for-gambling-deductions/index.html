In addition, taxpayers may only claim losses up to the amount of their winnings.</p>
<p>“The new guidelines are intended to clarify how taxpayers should report gambling income and losses,” said Oklahoma Tax Commission spokesperson Paula Ross. “The goal is to ensure that everyone is following the same rules.”</p>
<p>Taxpayers who want to take advantage of the gambling loss deduction must fill out Form 5754, Gambling Losses Deduction. The form must be attached to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return.</p>
<p>Ross said that the commission has been working on the new guidelines for some time and that they were prompted by recent changes to the federal tax code.</p>
