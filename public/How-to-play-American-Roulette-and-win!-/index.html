Look no further! This guide will teach you the basics of the game, as well as how to increase your odds of winning.</p>
<p>To begin, let’s learn the different bet types that are available in American Roulette:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Straight up bet - A bet on a single number. The payout odds are 35-1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split bet - A bet on two adjacent numbers. The payout odds are 17-1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Street bet - A bet on three consecutive numbers on one horizontal line. The payout odds are 11-1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Corner bet - A bet on four adjacent numbers that form a square. The payout odds are 8-1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Six line bet - A bet on six consecutive numbers across two horizontal lines. The payout odds are 5-1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Column or dozen bet - A bet on all twelve numbers in either a column or a dozen (3x12). The payout odds for both bets are 2-1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>   So now that you know the different types of bets, let’s learn how to place them:  </p>
<p>To place a straight up bet, simply click on the desired number on the betting board and then place your chips directly on top of that number on the table layout grid.  To place a split bet, click on two adjacent numbers and then place your chips between those two numbers on the table layout grid (see image below).  To place a street bet, click and drag your mouse cursor along the row of three numbers you wish to wager on and then release your mouse button (see image below). Your chips will automatically be placed in the correct position for you once you have released your mouse button .  To place a corner bet, click and drag your mouse cursor along the four adjacent numbers that you wish to wager on and then release your mouse button (see image below). Your chips will automatically be placed in the correct position for you once you have released your mouse button .  To place a six line bet, click and drag your mouse cursor along the six consecutive numbers you wish to wager on and then release your mouse button (see image below). Your chips will automatically be placed in the correct position for you once you have released your mouse button . Lastly, to place either a column or dozen bet, click one of these options beneath the betting board and then place your chips directly below it onto the table layout grid (see image below).</p>
<p>  And that’s all there is to it! Now that you know how to correctly place all of the different types of bets, it’s time to learn about some basic strategy tips that can help increase your chances of winning: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>always make sure to spread out your bets across as many different possible outcomes as possible; this will minimize any potential losses if one or more of your chosen outcomes don’t come in</p>
</li>
<li><p>keep an eye out for any sequences of numbers which seem to come up more often than others; these “hot” sequences can be used to help inform where you should place future bets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-to-beat-the-casino-at-American-Roulette"><a href="#How-to-beat-the-casino-at-American-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="How to beat the casino at American Roulette!"></a>How to beat the casino at American Roulette!</h1><p>American Roulette is a casino game that is played with a wheel that has 38 slots, numbered 1 through 36, plus 0 and 00. A ball is spun around the wheel and players must guess where it will end up. If they guess correctly, they win!</p>
<p>While American Roulette may seem like a daunting game to beat, there are a few strategies that you can use to improve your chances of winning. In this article, we will discuss some of the most popular strategies for playing American Roulette.</p>
<p>One of the simplest strategies for playing American Roulette is to only bet on black or red numbers. This strategy is known as even money betting and it gives you a 50% chance of winning each bet.</p>
<p>Another popular strategy for playing American Roulette is called the Martingale System. The Martingale System involves doubling your bet after every loss until you eventually win. This system can be risky, but it does offer the potential for big wins if you are lucky enough to hit a winning streak.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a more conservative approach to betting on American Roulette, you can try the Fibonacci System. The Fibonacci System involves increasing your bets by predetermined amounts after every win and loss. This system allows you to make smaller bets while still giving you a chance to win big if Lady Luck is on your side.</p>
<p>No matter which strategy you choose to use when playing American Roulette, be sure to always gamble responsibly and never bet more than you can afford to lose. Good luck and have fun!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-win-at-American-Roulette-secret-tips-revealed"><a href="#How-to-win-at-American-Roulette-secret-tips-revealed" class="headerlink" title="How to win at American Roulette - secret tips revealed!"></a>How to win at American Roulette - secret tips revealed!</h1><p>In this article we will be exploring the best and worst ways to play American Roulette in order to optimise your chances of winning.</p>
<p>First of all, let’s take a look at the basic rules of the game: </p>
<ul>
<li>There are 38 slots on the wheel, numbered 0-36. </li>
<li>Players can bet on any number, or a range of numbers, as well as black or red, even or odd, and high or low. </li>
<li>The wheel is spun and the ball is dropped into one of the slots. If your bet matches where the ball ends up, you win!</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few different things that you can do in order to improve your chances of winning at American Roulette. Firstly, always bet on black or red rather than an individual number - this increases your chances of winning from 18.5% to 47.3%. Secondly, avoid betting on even or odd - these have odds of only 1:1 and so offer very poor value for money. Instead, concentrate on betting on high or low (odds of 2:1) which give you a better chance of winning without risking too much money. Finally, remember to vary your bets - if you keep betting the same amount each time, you’re far more likely to lose money in the long run.</p>
<h1 id="The-best-way-to-win-at-American-Roulette"><a href="#The-best-way-to-win-at-American-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="The best way to win at American Roulette"></a>The best way to win at American Roulette</h1><p>There are a number of ways that people try to win at American Roulette, but the truth is that the best way to win consistently is to use a system. A system allows you to make calculated decisions about where to place your bets, which gives you a better chance of winning in the long run.</p>
<p>There are a number of systems that you can use, but the simplest and most effective is the Martingale system. With this system, you start by betting a small amount of money on one particular number. If you lose, you double your bet for the next round. If you win, you go back to betting the original amount. This system keeps increasing your bet size until you eventually win, at which point you start over again with the original bet amount. </p>
<p>While this system may seem risky, it actually gives you a very good chance of winning in the long run. The key is to make sure that you have enough money to keep doubling your bet each time you lose; if you run out of money, then you will have to start over again from scratch. </p>
<p>Another thing to note about the Martingale system is that it only works on even-money bets, such as black or red, or 1-18 or 19-36. Bets on individual numbers are not recommended with this system, as they offer much lower odds of winning and carry a higher risk. </p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to increase your chances of winning at American Roulette, then using a system like Martingale is definitely the way to go. Make sure that you have enough money set aside so that you can continue doubling your bets if needed, and keep track of your progress so that you can adjust your bets accordingly. With a little bit of practice,you’ll be able to use this system to beat American Roulette every time!</p>
<h1 id="Easy-ways-to-win-at-American-Roulette"><a href="#Easy-ways-to-win-at-American-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Easy ways to win at American Roulette"></a>Easy ways to win at American Roulette</h1><p>Most people think that roulette is a game of chance and that there is no way to win. While it is true that luck does play a role in the game, there are some easy ways to improve your chances of winning.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to win at American roulette is to play the even money bets. These bets include betting on black or red, odd or even, and high or low. By playing these bets, you are essentially betting on the 50/50 chance that the ball will land on the number you selected.</p>
<p>Another easy way to win at roulette is to bet on specific numbers. This can be done by betting on either a single number or a group of numbers. If you are able to correctly guess which number the ball will land on, you will win big!</p>
<p>Finally, another easy way to win at American roulette is to use a strategy known as “d’Alembert”. This strategy involves increasing your bet when you lose and decreasing your bet when you win. While this strategy may not work all the time, it can help you to break even or even make a small profit over time.</p>
