<h1 id="Could-Turkey-Bingo-be-the-Next-Big-Thing-in-Brazil"><a href="#Could-Turkey-Bingo-be-the-Next-Big-Thing-in-Brazil" class="headerlink" title="Could Turkey Bingo be the Next Big Thing in Brazil?"></a>Could Turkey Bingo be the Next Big Thing in Brazil?</h1><p>If you’re looking for a new and exciting game to play while in Brazil, look no further than Turkey Bingo. This relatively new game is sweeping the nation, and for good reason - it’s a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Here’s how Turkey Bingo works: players are given a sheet of paper with a grid of numbers on it. They then take turns calling out numbers. If someone has a number called that is on their sheet, they can mark it off. The first player to mark off all of their numbers wins the game.</p>
<p>Turkey Bingo is especially popular with children, as it is a fun way to learn about numbers. But adults can also enjoy the game - it’s perfect for parties or family gatherings. Plus, since it’s so easy to learn, just about anyone can play.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Grab some friends and head to Brazil for some exciting Turkey Bingo action!</p>

<h1 id="Brazilian-Bank-Launches-Turkish-Bingo-Gaming-Platform"><a href="#Brazilian-Bank-Launches-Turkish-Bingo-Gaming-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Brazilian Bank Launches Turkish Bingo Gaming Platform"></a>Brazilian Bank Launches Turkish Bingo Gaming Platform</h1><p>Banking giant Banco do Brasil has announced the launch of a new Turkish bingo gaming platform. The move is seen as an attempt to tap into the fast-growing Turkish bingo market, which is expected to be worth $2.5 billion by 2021.</p>
<p>The new platform, called TurBingo, offers players a range of Turkish bingo games, including 90-ball and 75-ball variants. Players can also win prizes worth up to $50,000.</p>
<p>Banco do Brasil’s head of e-commerce, Alberto Ramos, said that the TurBingo platform would offer “a unique and differentiated experience” for Turkish bingo players.</p>
<p>The launch of TurBingo comes at a time of rapid growth for the Turkish bingo market. In 2017, the market was estimated to be worth $1.5 billion, and it is expected to grow by around 15% per year over the next few years.</p>
<p>Turkey is one of the world’s most populous countries, with a population of around 80 million people. This makes it an attractive market for online gaming platforms such as TurBingo.</p>
<p>Banco do Brasil is not the only bank looking to tap into this potential market. In March 2018, French banking giant BNP Paribas also announced plans to launch a Turkish bingo platform.</p>
