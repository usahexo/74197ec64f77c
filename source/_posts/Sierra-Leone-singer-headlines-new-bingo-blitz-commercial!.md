#  Sierra Leone singer headlines new bingo blitz commercial!

Which West African singer is fronting the new commercial for Bingo Blitz, the popular online bingo game? It’s none other than Sierra Leone’s very own international recording artist, Adnan "Africa" Sesay!

The commercial features Adnan in a recording studio singing and playing the keyboard, with scenes of people playing Bingo Blitz in the background. The lyrics of the song extol the virtues of the game, praising its ability to bring people together and create moments of joy.

Adnan was born in Freetown, Sierra Leone, in 1988. At the age of six, he began learning to play the keyboard and started writing his own songs at age 14. In 2007, he won a national contest to identify Sierra Leone’s most talented young musician, and his star began to rise from there.

Since then, Adnan has released two solo albums and collaborated with several other artists, including Grammy-nominated guitarist Seckou Keita. His music has been featured on BBC radio and TV, and he has performed all over Africa and Europe.

We caught up with Adnan to ask him about his involvement in the new Bingo Blitz commercial. “I’m really excited about it!” he said. “The song is about how bingo brings people together for fun and laughter – something that we need more of in these troubled times. I hope everyone will enjoy it!”
