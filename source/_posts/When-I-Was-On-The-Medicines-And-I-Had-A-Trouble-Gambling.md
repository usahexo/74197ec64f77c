#  When I Was On The Medicines And I Had A Trouble Gambling

I started gambling when I was prescribed some medicines by my doctor. I didn't know that the medicines would increase my urge to gamble. I went to a casino and started playing slot machines.

I gambled for a few hours and then I decided to leave. As I was walking out, I noticed that I had lost all of my money. I was so embarrassed that I had lost all of my money.

I went home and told my wife what had happened. She was really mad at me and she told me that I needed to stop gambling. She said that it was wasting our money and that it was dangerous.

I agreed with her and said that I would stop gambling. The next day, I called the casino and asked them to block my account. They said that they could do that and they also refunded me the money that I had lost.

Since then, I haven't gambled at all. It's been about six months since I last gambled and I don't plan on gambling again anytime soon. Gambling can be really addictive and it can ruin your life if you're not careful.

#  I'm From Mongolia But Trouble Gambling

Mongolia is a fascinating country located in East Asia. It is bordered by Russia and China. The official language is Mongolian, which is the first language of about 25% of the population. Despite being landlocked, Mongolia has a rich equestrian culture and is famous for its Genghis Khan-era monuments.

With a population of around 3 million, Mongolia has a small but thriving gambling industry. In 2017, total casino revenue was estimated at $176 million, making up 0.5% of GDP. This may seem small, but it's actually quite impressive when you consider that there are only 12 casinos in the entire country!

The problem is that most of this gambling revenue comes from locals, and many Mongolians are poorly equipped to gamble responsibly. In fact, one study found that 61% of Mongolian casino patrons exhibited problem gambling behavior. This has led to some major social problems, including rising levels of debt and crime.

In an effort to address these concerns, the Mongolian government recently imposed new restrictions on gambling. As of January 1st, 2018, locals are no longer allowed to gamble in casinos unless they are accompanied by a foreign passport holder. This has caused a lot of confusion and anger among Mongolians, who feel that they are being unfairly targeted.

Whether or not these new restrictions will be effective remains to be seen. In the meantime, Mongolians will just have to hope that their government can find a way to balance the need for gambling revenue with the need to protect its citizens from its harmful effects.

#  It's Hard Out Here For A Pokie 

There's no doubt about it, the pokie industry is a tough one. With so much competition and so many options for players, it can be hard to make a profit in the industry. 

One of the ways that pokie operators try to attract players is by offering them bonuses. These bonuses can take many different forms, but they all have one goal in mind – getting players to deposit more money into their accounts. 

Unfortunately, many players fall for these bonuses without understanding the terms and conditions that come with them. This can lead to them losing a lot of money in a very short period of time. 

It's therefore important that players understand the different types of bonuses available to them, as well as the risks associated with each one. Only by doing this can they make an informed decision about whether or not to claim a bonus. 

The most common type of bonus offered by pokie operators is the deposit bonus. As the name suggests, this bonus is awarded to players who make a deposit into their account. In most cases, the size of the bonus will be determined by how much money you deposit. 

Some operators also offer free spins as part of their deposit bonuses. These free spins are typically given out in batches of 10 or 20 and they allow players to spin the reels on certain pokies games without spending any of their own money. 

While free spins are a great way to get started playing pokies games, they come with some risks attached. For example, most free spins have a wagering requirement attached to them. This means that you need to bet a certain amount of money before you can withdraw any winnings you may have accrued while playing with them. 

Another thing to keep in mind when using free spins is that not all games qualify for wagering requirements. So if you only play slots games then you may find that your wins are locked up tight until you meet the playthrough requirement. 

A slightly less common type of bonus is the no-deposit bonus. As its name suggests, this bonus doesn't require players to make any deposits into their account in order to claim it. Instead, it's usually awarded as soon as you sign up for an account with an operator. 

No-deposit bonuses come with some pretty hefty wagering requirements though, so be careful before accepting one. Many times these requirements can be impossible to meet, which means you'll end up losing your bonus and any winnings you may have accrued while playing with it. 

The final type of bonus worth mentioning is the match bonus. This type of bonus is usually offered by new pokie operators and it allows players to double or even triple their first deposit into the site. 

While match bonuses sound great on paper, they often come with high wagering requirements as well as minimum bets requirements too. So before accepting one, be sure to read through all the terms and conditions so that you know what you're getting yourself into!

#  Gambling Addiction Led To Financial Ruin

In the United States, one in every 25 adults is diagnosed with a gambling addiction. For these people, gambling can become a destructive force in their lives, leading to financial ruin and even suicide.

Gambling addiction usually starts out as a recreational activity, but for some people it can quickly spiral out of control. Gambling can be addictive because it releases dopamine in the brain, which is a chemical that creates feelings of pleasure. This feeling of pleasure can be so strong that it overrides any negative consequences that may come from gambling, such as losing money.

People with gambling addictions often try to hide their problem from friends and family members. They may start lying about how much money they are spending on gambling or claiming that they are winning when they are actually losing money. This behavior can be very destructive, leading to marital problems and job loss.

In extreme cases, people with gambling addictions can lose all their money and end up homeless or in prison. In 2017, there were more than 8 million adults in the United States with diagnosable gambling problems, and the majority of them suffered negative consequences as a result of their addiction.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. Treatment options include therapy or medication-assisted treatment. There are also support groups available for people with gambling addictions, such as Gamblers Anonymous.
