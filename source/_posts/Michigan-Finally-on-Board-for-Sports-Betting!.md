#  Michigan Finally on Board for Sports Betting!

After years of waiting, Michigan is finally on board for sports betting. The state’s legislature has passed a bill that would allow for casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, pending the signature of Governor Rick Snyder.

If signed, the new law will make Michigan the 10th state to legalize sports betting. It would also allow Detroit’s three casinos and four of the state’s 17 racetracks to offer it.

The passage of this bill is great news for the gaming industry in Michigan. It will provide an additional stream of revenue for casinos and racetracks, and it will create jobs in the state. It will also be a boon for bettors, who will now have more options when it comes to placing bets on their favorite teams.

The only downside is that the bill prohibits online and mobile betting. This could limit Michigan’s ability to compete with other states that have already legalized online gambling.

Overall, however, the passage of this bill is a positive development for the gaming industry in Michigan. It should help create jobs and boost tourism in the state, while providing residents with a new way to enjoy their favorite sports teams.

#  Michigan Adds Vegas x Slots to Internet Sports Betting Menu

Michigan, the state that brought you Motor City Casino and the Detroit Lions, now has Vegas x Slots available on the internet for sports betting.

The launch of Vegas x Slots follows Michigan's legalization of online sports betting in December 2018. The new law allows Michigan bettors to place wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events through approved, licensed operators.

According to the Detroit Free Press, Michigan's first licensed operator is MGM Grand Detroit, which offers a mobile app that includes Vegas x Slots. Other approved operators include FanDuel Sportsbook, PointsBet USA, and DraftKings Sportsbook.

The Detroit Lions aren't the only team in the state with something to celebrate. MGM Grand Detroit also has a reason to crow about its new online venture because it is one of six casino companies with a license to offer internet sports betting in Michigan.

What does this mean for Michigan bettors? In short, there are now more options than ever before when it comes to placing bets on sporting events. And with more options come better odds and bigger payouts.

Michigan bettors can now choose from a variety of online sportsbooks, each with its own unique set of betting lines and options. In addition to traditional bets such as straight bets, parlays, and over/unders, bettors can also wager on propositions (such as who will win the next game), futures (such as who will win the Super Bowl), and even virtual sports (such as horse racing or car racing).

With so many choices available, how do you know which site is right for you? One way to start is by checking out reviews of different sites. Another is to consult with an experienced gambler who can recommend a site that matches your individual preferences and betting style.

#  Michigan Now Offers Legal Internet Sports Betting with Vegas x Slots

LANSING, Mich. — In a sweeping decision that could have national implications, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the state’s prohibition on Internet sports betting does not apply to casinos operating in Detroit.

The unanimous ruling said the 2006 law that bans online sports betting “does not apply to casino gaming authorized by the Detroit Casino Control Act.”

That means Motor City casinos can now offer legal Internet sports betting, joining a growing list of states where the activity is allowed.

The court’s opinion hinges on a key distinction between casinos and other forms of gambling, such as horse racing and lotteries: Casinos are regulated by their home state, while other forms of gambling are typically regulated by the federal government.

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette had argued that the 2006 law applies to all forms of gambling. But justices ruled that because casino gaming is specifically authorized by state statute, it is exempt from the ban on online sports betting.

Representatives for MGM Grand Detroit and Greektown Casino-Hotel did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon.

“This is great news for Detroit casino operators and their customers who want to enjoy legal sports betting,” said Dan Korobkin, deputy legal director of ACLU of Michigan, which represented MotorCity Casino in the case. “The court rightly recognized that state law authorizes casino gaming and that this type of gaming is exempt from Michigan’s ban on online sports betting.”



When Michigan's legislature passed a bill outlawing internet sports betting in 2006, they probably didn't realize they were just pushing business out to Detroit's casinos. But yesterday, in a unanimous ruling by the Michigan Supreme Court, it was decided that this ban does not apply to casino gaming authorized by the Detroit Casino Control Act - meaning Detroit's casinos can now offer legal internet sports betting. This ruling is seen as a victory for Detroit's casino operators and their customers who will now be able to enjoy legal sports betting without having to cross state lines.
