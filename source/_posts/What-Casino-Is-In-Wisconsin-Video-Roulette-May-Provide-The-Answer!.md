Wisconsin's Ho-Chunk Nation is set to debut its new video roulette machines on Feb. 1 in tandem with the launch of a new tribal casino in Beloit, Wis.

The video roulette games will be located in the "High Limit" section of the casino and offer players the chance to win up to $10,000 on a single bet.

Casino officials are billing the new games as "a more thrilling experience than traditional roulette."

The move by the Ho-Chunk Nation comes at a time when other tribes around the country are also expanding their gambling offerings to include more video poker and slot machines.

Despite this trend, however, roulette remains one of the most popular table games in U.S. casinos. In fact, according to The Wizard of Odds website, American Roulette has an expected return of 94.7 percent when playing optimally - making it one of the best bets you can make in a casino.
